With one-click deployment  using the Heroku Button, you accomplished the following:

    * Installed an instance of a MySQL database (JawsDB MySQL)
    * Installed an event broker (CloudAMQP, which is a hosted RabbitMQ server). You also created a queue for containing your event payload in the RabbitMQ instance.
    * Created two tables in MySQL schema (Customers & Leads tables)
    * Deployed a pre-written PHP CRUD application 
    * Configured your PHP CRUD application to connect to the newly installed MySQL database

When you sign in to your Heroku instance, you can navigate to “https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps” to manage your newly installed app, add more resources from Heroku Elements (https://elements.heroku.com/), configure access & settings or monitor metrics & activity. 

*Bonus*: If you have signed up for a GitHub account, you can optionally fork the repository (https://github.com/lightningexperience/finscabin)  and examine the  code which gives you a starter PHP CRUD app. This repository can serve as an *easy example of how to create and deploy applications on Heroku*. Trick question: How will you make changes in your forked GitHub repo so they are reflected in your app deployed on Heroku?
